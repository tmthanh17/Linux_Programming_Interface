/*
vfork() function
No duplication of virtual memory pages or page tables is done for the child
process. Instead, the child shares the parentâ€™s memory until it either performs
a successful exec() or calls _exit() to terminate.

Execution of the parent process is suspended until the child has performed an
exec() or _exit().

The child is guaranteed to be scheduled for the CPU before the parent
